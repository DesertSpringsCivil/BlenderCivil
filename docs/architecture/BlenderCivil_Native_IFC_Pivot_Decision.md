# BlenderCivil: The Native IFC Pivot Decision
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** üöÄ PIVOTAL MOMENT - Strategic Architecture Decision  
**Decision:** PIVOT TO NATIVE IFC AUTHORING

---

## üìã Executive Summary

**This document captures a critical turning point in BlenderCivil's development.** After deep research into Bonsai (BlenderBIM), competitive analysis, and market assessment, we have made the strategic decision to pivot BlenderCivil from an "IFC-aligned export" model to **true native IFC authoring** - making it the world's first open-source, native IFC roadway design platform.

**Bottom Line:** We're not just building another roadway design tool. We're pioneering **Native IFC Civil Engineering**.

## üéØ The Question That Changed Everything

### Original Architecture (v0.3)
- ‚úÖ Separate entity system (Tangents, Curves, PIs as Blender objects)
- ‚úÖ PointerProperty relationships
- ‚úÖ IFC-compatible hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Professional workflow matching Civil 3D/OpenRoads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BUT:** Data stored in Blender's system, not in IFC
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Export to IFC** at the end (like Civil 3D/OpenRoads)

### The Critical Question
> "Everything we've discussed about BlenderCivil - could it be considered native-IFC modeling? Or are we just exporting to IFC at the end of design like Civil 3D and OpenRoads do?"

### The Answer
**We were doing "export to IFC" - NOT native IFC modeling.** This realization led to deep research into how Bonsai actually works.

## üî¨ Research Findings: How Bonsai Really Works

### Bonsai's Architecture (TRUE Native IFC)

**1. IFC File is the Source of Truth**
- An actual `.ifc` file is loaded and kept in memory using IfcOpenShell
- All data (properties, relationships, geometry) lives in the IFC file
- Accessed via: `IfcStore.get_file()`

**2. Blender Objects are Just a "Cache"**
- Blender objects are temporary visualizations of IFC data
- They only store minimal linking data (entity ID, GlobalId)
- Properties are NOT stored in Blender's custom properties
- Quote: *"All the data is stored in IFC directly and Blender is simply a client"*

**3. Synchronization Model**
- Move an object ‚Üí Updates IFC file
- Save ‚Üí Saves the `.ifc` file (not just `.blend`)
- The `.blend` stores cache + path to IFC file

**4. Direct IFC Operations**
```python
# Bonsai workflow:
ifc_file = IfcStore.get_file()
walls = ifc_file.by_type("IfcWall")
for wall in walls:
    wall.Name  # IFC attribute, not Blender property
```

### Key Comparison: Bonsai vs Our Current Approach

| Aspect | Bonsai | BlenderCivil v0.3 |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Data Storage** | IFC file in memory | Blender objects |
| **Properties** | Stored in IFC entities | Blender PropertyGroups |
| **Relationships** | IfcRelNests (in IFC) | PointerProperty (Blender) |
| **Save Operation** | Saves IFC file | Saves .blend file |
| **Export** | Already IS IFC | Convert Blender ‚Üí IFC |
| **Philosophy** | IFC-first, Blender is UI | Blender-first, IFC is output |

## üíé The Market Gap

### What Exists Today

| Software | Native IFC | Roadway Tools | Open Source |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Bonsai | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| FreeCAD Road | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

‚úÖ IFC 4.3 compliant from day one  

**BlenderCivil would be the FIRST tool combining all of these.**

---

## üéØ Strategic Decision: PIVOT TO NATIVE IFC

### Why This is the Right Move

**1. No Direct Competition**
- Literally no one is doing native IFC roadway authoring
- Closest is FreeCAD Road (not native IFC) and Bonsai (no civil tools)

**2. Market Demand is Real**
- Civil engineers on Bonsai forums asking for these features
- Active OSArch discussions (Feb 2025) about alignment authoring
- IFC 4.3 is ISO standard but barely implemented

**3. Technical Foundation Exists**
- IfcOpenShell already supports alignment geometry
- Bonsai pattern is proven and mature
- We can leverage existing infrastructure

**4. Unique Value Proposition**
- "Bonsai for Roadway Design"
- First mover advantage in native IFC civil engineering
- Community will support this initiative

**5. Our Work Isn't Wasted**
- We've proven the workflow and UI concepts
- We understand professional software patterns
- Now we rebuild on the right foundation

### What We're Pioneering

**A New Category:** "Native IFC Civil Engineering"

BlenderCivil will be to roads what Bonsai is to buildings - but we'll be **FIRST** in this space.

## üìä Architecture Comparison

### OLD Approach (v0.3): IFC-Aligned Export

```
Design Flow:
1. Create PI Empties in Blender
2. Store data in Blender custom properties
3. Create Tangent/Curve objects (Blender)
4. Relationships via PointerProperty (Blender)
5. [Future] Map to IFC at export
6. Write .ifc file

Data Model:
- Alignment_Root (Blender Empty)
  - Custom Properties (Blender)
  - PointerProperty relationships (Blender)
  - Tangent_001 (Blender Curve)
  - Curve_001 (Blender Curve)
```

**Advantages:**
- Fast to develop
- Leverage Blender features natively
- Familiar Blender workflow

**Disadvantages:**
- Not true native IFC
- Complex mapping at export
- Potential data loss
- "Yet another converter"

---

### NEW Approach: True Native IFC

```
Design Flow:
1. Create IFC file in memory (IfcOpenShell)
2. Create IfcAlignment entity
3. Create IfcAlignmentHorizontal entity
4. Create IfcAlignmentSegment entities (IFC)
5. Generate Blender visualization (cache)
6. Save ‚Üí IFC file updated directly

Data Model:
- IFC File (IfcOpenShell in memory)
  ‚îú‚îÄ IfcProject
  ‚îî‚îÄ IfcAlignment
     ‚îî‚îÄ IfcAlignmentHorizontal
        ‚îú‚îÄ IfcAlignmentSegment (LINE)
        ‚îú‚îÄ IfcAlignmentSegment (CIRCULARARC)
        ‚îî‚îÄ IfcAlignmentSegment (LINE)

- Blender Objects (Visualization Cache)
  ‚îú‚îÄ obj["ifc_definition_id"] = segment.id()
  ‚îî‚îÄ Visual representation only
```

**Advantages:**
- **TRUE native IFC** - data lives in IFC format
- No export conversion needed
- IFC compliant by definition
- Industry credibility ("native IFC authoring")
- Can use all IfcOpenShell tools
- Roundtrip compatibility guaranteed

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex initial setup
- Must manage IFC ‚Üî Blender sync
- Steeper learning curve for developers

## üéì Learning from Bonsai

### Key Patterns to Adopt

**1. IfcStore Pattern**
```python
from bonsai.bim.ifc import IfcStore
ifc_file = IfcStore.get_file()
```

**2. Entity Linking**
```python
obj = bpy.data.objects.new("PI_001", None)
obj["ifc_definition_id"] = alignment.id()
```

**3. Tool Architecture**
- Separate `tool/` modules (like Bonsai)
- Use IfcOpenShell API calls
- Keep UI separate from business logic

**4. Synchronization**
- Update IFC first
- Then update Blender cache
- Use depsgraph handlers for visual updates

**5. Module Structure**
```
