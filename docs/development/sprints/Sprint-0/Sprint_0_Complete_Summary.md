## üí° Key Insights

### What We Learned

**1. Native IFC is Superior**

- No data loss (impossible)
- No synchronization bugs (single source of truth)
- Simpler code (no mapping layer)

**2. Bonsai's Pattern Works for Civil**

- Entity linking is elegant
- Minimal Blender storage is key
- File-based projects work great

**3. IFC 4.3 is Powerful**
- Alignment structure is well-designed
- IfcAlignmentSegment is flexible
- Relationship model is clean
- Standard is production-ready

**4. Blender is Perfect for This**
- Excellent 3D visualization
- Flexible data model
- Python integration
- Active community

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### The Golden Pattern

```
1. GET IFC FILE
   ifc = NativeIfcManager.get_file()

2. CREATE IFC ENTITY FIRST
   segment = ifc.create_entity("IfcAlignmentSegment", ...)

3. CREATE BLENDER VISUALIZATION SECOND  
   curve = bpy.data.objects.new("Segment", curve_data)

4. LINK THEM
   NativeIfcManager.link_object(curve, segment)

5. SAVE = WRITE IFC FILE
   NativeIfcManager.save_file("project.ifc")
```

**This pattern is the foundation of everything we build.**

### Minimal Blender Storage

```python
# ONLY 3 properties per object:
obj["ifc_definition_id"] = 42
obj["ifc_class"] = "IfcAlignmentSegment"
obj["GlobalId"] = "2x3b5K..."

# Everything else comes from IFC!
```

**This is why we have zero synchronization bugs.**
